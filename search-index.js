See the OpenShift Container Platform documentation for a full introduction to OpenShift Container Platform. CRC includes the crc command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the CRC instance using the desired container runtime. The OpenShift preset for CRC provides a regular OpenShift Container Platform installation with the following notable differences: The OpenShift Container Platform cluster is ephemeral and is not intended for production use. CRC does not have a supported upgrade path to newer OpenShift Container Platform versions. Upgrading the OpenShift Container Platform version might cause issues that are difficult to reproduce. It uses a single node, which behaves as both a control plane and worker node. It disables the Cluster Monitoring Operator by default. This disabled Operator causes the corresponding part of the web console to be non-functional. It disables the following operators: Cloud Credential Operator. Cluster Autoscaler Operator. Cloud Controller Manager Operator. The OpenShift Container Platform cluster runs in a virtual machine known as an instance. This might cause other differences, particularly with external networking. The OpenShift Container Platform cluster provided by CRC also includes the following non-customizable cluster settings. These settings should not be modified: The *.crc.testing domain. The address range used for internal cluster communication. The cluster uses the 172 address range.

The crc.testing domain is for core OpenShift Container Platform services. The apps-crc.testing domain is for accessing OpenShift applications deployed on the cluster. For example, the OpenShift Container Platform API server is exposed as api.crc.testing while the OpenShift Container Platform console is accessed as console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing. These DNS domains are served by a dnsmasq DNS container running inside the CRC instance. The crc setup command detects and adjusts your system DNS configuration so that it can resolve these domains. Additional checks are done to verify DNS is properly configured when running crc start. On Linux, depending on your distribution, CRC expects the following DNS configuration: This configuration is used by default on Fedora 33 or newer, and on Ubuntu Desktop editions. CRC expects NetworkManager to manage networking. CRC configures systemd-resolved to forward requests for the testing domain to the 192.168.130.11 DNS server. 192.168.130.11 is the IP of the CRC instance. systemd-resolved configuration is done with a NetworkManager dispatcher script in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-crc.sh: #!/bin/sh export LC_ALL=C systemd-resolve --interface crc --set-dns 192.168.130.11 --set-domain ~testing exit 0 systemd-resolved is also available as an unsupported Technology Preview on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS 8.3. After configuring the host to use systemd-resolved, stop any running clusters and rerun crc setup. This configuration is used by default on Fedora 32 or older, on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and on CentOS. CRC expects NetworkManager to manage networking. NetworkManager uses dnsmasq with the /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/crc-nm-dnsmasq.conf configuration file. The configuration file for this dnsmasq instance is /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/crc.conf: server=/crc.testing/192.168.130.11 server=/apps-crc.testing/192.168.130.11 The NetworkManager dnsmasq instance forwards requests for the crc.testing and apps-crc.testing domains to the 192.168.130.11 DNS server. The OpenShift Container Platform cluster managed by CRC reserves IP subnets for internal use, which should not collide with your host network. Ensure that the following IP subnets are available for use: Reserved IP subnets 10.217.0.0/22 10.217.4.0/23 192.168.126.0/24 Additionally, the host hypervisor might reserve another IP subnet depending on the host operating system. No additional subnet is reserved on macOS and Microsoft Windows. The additional reserved subnet for Linux is 192.168.130.0/24. You can start CRC behind a defined proxy using environment variables or configurable properties. SOCKS proxies are not supported by OpenShift Container Platform. Prerequisites If you are not using crc oc-env, when interacting with the cluster, export the .testing domain as part of the no_proxy environment variable. The embedded oc executable does not require manual settings. For more information about using the embedded oc executable, see Accessing the OpenShift cluster with the OpenShift CLI. Procedure Define a proxy using the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables or using the crc config set command as follows: $ crc config set http-proxy http://proxy.example.com: $ crc config set https-proxy http://proxy.example.com: $ crc config set no-proxy If the proxy uses a custom CA certificate file, set it as follows: $ crc config set proxy-ca-file Proxy-related values set in the configuration for CRC have priority over values set with environment variables. When you run services on your host, you can configure CRC to access these services. Prerequisites You have a service which is running on your host and want to consume it with CRC. You are using the user mode network. On macOS and Microsoft Windows this is the default behavior. Procedure Enable accessing services from host to CRC: $ crc config set host-network-access true Verify that the CRC configuration uses user network mode and enables host network access: $ crc config view [...] - network-mode : user - host-network-access : true [...] If CRC instance is already running then restart it (stop ⇒ start), otherwise just start it. $ crc stop && crc start Verification Assuming your service is running on the host on port 8080, to access it from the CRC instance, use host.crc.testing:8080. Configure a remote server to run an OpenShift Container Platform cluster provided by CRC. This procedure assumes the use of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, or CentOS server. Run every command in this procedure on the remote server. Perform this procedure only on a local network. Exposing an insecure server on the internet has many security implications. Prerequisites CRC is installed and set up on the remote server. For more information, see Installing CRC and Setting up CRC. CRC is configured to use the OpenShift preset on the remote server. For more information, see Changing the selected preset. Your user account has sudo permissions on the remote server. Procedure Start the cluster: $ crc start Ensure that the cluster remains running during this procedure. Install the haproxy package and other utilities: $ sudo dnf install haproxy /usr/sbin/semanage Modify the firewall to allow communication with the cluster: $ sudo systemctl enable --now firewalld $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=https --permanent $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=kube-apiserver --permanent $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload For SELinux, allow HAProxy to listen on TCP port 6443 to serve kube-apiserver on this port: $ sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 6443 Create a backup of the default haproxy configuration: $ sudo cp /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg{,.bak} Configure haproxy for use with the cluster: $ export CRC_IP=$(crc ip) $ sudo tee /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg &>/dev/null /dev/null /dev/null <<EOF address=/apps-crc.testing/SERVER_IP_ADDRESS address=/api.crc.testing/SERVER_IP_ADDRESS EOF Comment out any existing entries in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/crc.conf. These entries are created by running a local instance of CRC and will conflict with the entries for the remote cluster. Reload the NetworkManager service: $ sudo systemctl reload NetworkManager Log in to the remote cluster as the developer user with oc: $ oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443 The remote OpenShift Container Platform web console is available at https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing.","title":"Networking","component":"getting_started","version":"","name":"networking","url":"/getting_started/getting_started/networking/","titles":[{"text":"DNS configuration details","hash":"_dns_configuration_details","id":1},{"text":"General DNS setup","hash":"_general_dns_setup","id":2},{"text":"DNS on Linux","hash":"_dns_on_linux","id":3},{"text":"NetworkManager + systemd-resolved","hash":"_networkmanager_systemd_resolved","id":4},{"text":"NetworkManager + dnsmasq","hash":"_networkmanager_dnsmasq","id":5},{"text":"Reserved IP subnets","hash":"_reserved_ip_subnets","id":6},{"text":"Starting CRC behind a proxy","hash":"_starting_crc_behind_a_proxy","id":7},{"text":"Accessing services running on your host from CRC","hash":"_accessing_services_running_on_your_host_from_crc","id":8},{"text":"Setting up CRC on a remote server","hash":"_setting_up_crc_on_a_remote_server","id":9},{"text":"Connecting to a remote CRC instance","hash":"_connecting_to_a_remote_crc_instance","id":10}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"The goal of CRC is to deliver an OpenShift Container Platform environment for development and testing purposes.

The system bundle of OpenShift Container Platform in each released crc executable expires 1 year after the release. This expiration is due to certificates embedded in the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The crc start command triggers an automatic certificate renewal process when needed. Certificate renewal can add up to five minutes to the start time of the cluster. To avoid this additional startup time, or in case of failures in the certificate renewal process, use the following procedure: Procedure To resolve expired certificate errors that cannot be automatically renewed: Download the latest CRC release and place the crc executable in your $PATH. Remove the cluster with certificate errors using the crc delete command: $ crc delete The crc delete command results in the loss of data stored in the CRC instance. Save any desired information stored in the instance before running this command. Set up the new release: $ crc setup Start the new instance: $ crc start Created CRC instances contain bundle information and instance data. Bundle information and instance data is not updated when setting up a new CRC release. This information is not updated due to customization in the earlier instance data. This will lead to errors when running the crc start command: $ crc start ... FATA Bundle 'crc_hyperkit_4.2.8.crcbundle' was requested, but the existing VM is using 'crc_hyperkit_4.2.2.crcbundle' Procedure Issue the crc delete command before attempting to start the instance: $ crc delete The crc delete command results in the loss of data stored in the CRC instance. Save any desired information stored in the instance before running this command. Resolve most issues by restarting CRC with a clean state. This involves stopping the instance, deleting it, reverting changes made by the crc setup command, reapplying those changes, and restarting the instance. Prerequisites You set up the host machine with the crc setup command. For more information, see Setting up CRC. You started CRC with the crc start command. For more information, see Starting the instance. You are using the latest CRC release. Using a version earlier than CRC 1.2.0 might result in errors related to expired x509 certificates. For more information, see Troubleshooting expired certificates. Procedure To troubleshoot CRC, perform the following steps: Stop the CRC instance: $ crc stop Delete the CRC instance: $ crc delete The crc delete command results in the loss of data stored in the CRC instance. Save any desired information stored in the instance before running this command. Clean up remaining changes from the crc setup command: $ crc cleanup The crc cleanup command removes an existing CRC instance and reverts changes to DNS entries created by the crc setup command. Set up your host machine to reapply the changes: $ crc setup Start the CRC instance: $ crc start The cluster takes a minimum of four minutes to start the necessary containers and Operators before serving a request. If your issue is not resolved by this procedure, perform the following steps: Search open issues for the issue that you are encountering. If no existing issue addresses the encountered issue, create an issue and attach the ~/.crc/crc.log file to the created issue. The ~/.crc/crc.log file has detailed debugging and troubleshooting information which can help diagnose the problem that you are experiencing.","title":"Troubleshooting CRC","component":"getting_started","version":"","name":"troubleshooting","url":"/getting_started/getting_started/troubleshooting/","titles":[{"text":"Getting shell access to the OpenShift cluster","hash":"_getting_shell_access_to_the_openshift_cluster","id":1},{"text":"Troubleshooting expired certificates","hash":"_troubleshooting_expired_certificates","id":2},{"text":"Troubleshooting bundle version mismatch","hash":"_troubleshooting_bundle_version_mismatch","id":3},{"text":"Troubleshooting unknown issues","hash":"_troubleshooting_unknown_issues","id":4}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"CRC presets represent a managed container runtime, and the lower bounds of system resources required by the instance to run it. CRC offers presets for: openshift OpenShift Container Platform okd OKD microshift MicroShift On Microsoft Windows and macOS, the CRC guided installer prompts you for your desired preset. On Linux, the OpenShift Container Platform preset is selected by default. You can change this selection using the crc config command before running the crc setup command. Only one preset can be active at a time. Additional resources For more information about the minimum system requirements for each preset, see Minimum system requirements. For more information on changing the selected preset, see Changing the selected preset. The crc setup command performs operations to set up the environment of your host machine for the CRC instance. The crc setup command creates the ~/.crc directory if it does not already exist. If you are setting up a new version, capture any changes made to the instance before setting up a new CRC release. Prerequisites On Linux or macOS, ensure that your user account has permission to use the sudo command. On Microsoft Windows, ensure that your user account can elevate to Administrator privileges. Do not run the crc executable as the root user or an administrator. Always run the crc executable with your user account. Procedure Set up your host machine for CRC: $ crc setup Additional resources For more information about the available container runtime presets, see About presets. The crc start command starts the CRC instance and configured container runtime. Prerequisites To avoid networking-related issues, ensure that you are not connected to a VPN and that your network connection is reliable. You set up the host machine using the crc setup command. For more information, see Setting up CRC. On Microsoft Windows, ensure that your user account can elevate to Administrator privileges. For the OpenShift preset, ensure that you have a valid OpenShift user pull secret. Copy or download the pull secret from the Pull Secret section of the CRC page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. Accessing the user pull secret requires a Red Hat account. Procedure Start the CRC instance: $ crc start For the OpenShift preset, supply your user pull secret when prompted. The cluster takes a minimum of four minutes to start the necessary containers and Operators before serving a request. Additional resources To change the default resources allocated to the instance, see Configuring the instance. If you see errors during crc start, see the Troubleshooting CRC section for potential solutions. Access the OpenShift Container Platform cluster running in the CRC instance by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console or OpenShift CLI (oc).
