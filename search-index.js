For other OpenShift Container Platform use cases, such as headless or multi-developer setups, use the full OpenShift installer. See the OpenShift Container Platform documentation for a full introduction to OpenShift Container Platform. CRC includes the crc command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the CRC instance using the desired container runtime. The OpenShift preset for CRC provides a regular OpenShift Container Platform installation with the following notable differences: The OpenShift Container Platform cluster is ephemeral and is not intended for production use. CRC does not have a supported upgrade path to newer OpenShift Container Platform versions. Upgrading the OpenShift Container Platform version might cause issues that are difficult to reproduce. It uses a single node, which behaves as both a control plane and worker node. It disables the Cluster Monitoring Operator by default. This disabled Operator causes the corresponding part of the web console to be non-functional. The OpenShift Container Platform cluster runs in a virtual machine known as an instance. This might cause other differences, particularly with external networking. The OpenShift Container Platform cluster provided by CRC also includes the following non-customizable cluster settings. These settings should not be modified: The *.crc.testing domain. The address range used for internal cluster communication. The cluster uses the 172 address range.

The crc.testing domain is for core OpenShift Container Platform services. The apps-crc.testing domain is for accessing OpenShift applications deployed on the cluster. For example, the OpenShift Container Platform API server is exposed as api.crc.testing while the OpenShift Container Platform console is accessed as console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing. These DNS domains are served by a dnsmasq DNS container running inside the CRC instance. The crc setup command detects and adjusts your system DNS configuration so that it can resolve these domains. Additional checks are done to verify DNS is properly configured when running crc start. On Linux, depending on your distribution, CRC expects the following DNS configuration: This configuration is used by default on Fedora 33 or newer, and on Ubuntu Desktop editions. CRC expects NetworkManager to manage networking. CRC configures systemd-resolved to forward requests for the testing domain to the 192.168.130.11 DNS server. 192.168.130.11 is the IP of the CRC instance. systemd-resolved configuration is done with a NetworkManager dispatcher script in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-crc.sh: #!/bin/sh export LC_ALL=C systemd-resolve --interface crc --set-dns 192.168.130.11 --set-domain ~testing exit 0 systemd-resolved is also available as an unsupported Technology Preview on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS 8.3. After configuring the host to use systemd-resolved, stop any running clusters and rerun crc setup. This configuration is used by default on Fedora 32 or older, on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and on CentOS. CRC expects NetworkManager to manage networking. NetworkManager uses dnsmasq with the /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/crc-nm-dnsmasq.conf configuration file. The configuration file for this dnsmasq instance is /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/crc.conf: server=/crc.testing/192.168.130.11 server=/apps-crc.testing/192.168.130.11 The NetworkManager dnsmasq instance forwards requests for the crc.testing and apps-crc.testing domains to the 192.168.130.11 DNS server. The OpenShift Container Platform cluster managed by CRC reserves IP subnets for internal use, which should not collide with your host network. Ensure that the following IP subnets are available for use: Reserved IP subnets 10.217.0.0/22 10.217.4.0/23 192.168.126.0/24 Additionally, the host hypervisor might reserve another IP subnet depending on the host operating system. No additional subnet is reserved on macOS and Microsoft Windows. The additional reserved subnet for Linux is 192.168.130.0/24. You can start CRC behind a defined proxy using environment variables or configurable properties. SOCKS proxies are not supported by OpenShift Container Platform. Prerequisites If you are not using crc oc-env, when interacting with the cluster, export the .testing domain as part of the no_proxy environment variable. The embedded oc executable does not require manual settings. For more information about using the embedded oc executable, see Accessing the OpenShift cluster with the OpenShift CLI. Procedure Define a proxy using the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables or using the crc config set command as follows: $ crc config set http-proxy http://proxy.example.com: $ crc config set https-proxy http://proxy.example.com: $ crc config set no-proxy If the proxy uses a custom CA certificate file, set it as follows: $ crc config set proxy-ca-file Proxy-related values set in the configuration for CRC have priority over values set with environment variables. Configure a remote server to run an OpenShift Container Platform cluster provided by CRC. This procedure assumes the use of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, or CentOS server. Run every command in this procedure on the remote server. Perform this procedure only on a local network. Exposing an insecure server on the internet has many security implications. Prerequisites CRC is installed and set up on the remote server. For more information, see Installing CRC and Setting up CRC. CRC is configured to use the OpenShift preset on the remote server. For more information, see Changing the selected preset. Your user account has sudo permissions on the remote server. Procedure Start the cluster: $ crc start Ensure that the cluster remains running during this procedure.

The system bundle of OpenShift Container Platform in each released crc executable expires 1 year after the release. This expiration is due to certificates embedded in the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The crc start command triggers an automatic certificate renewal process when needed. Certificate renewal can add up to five minutes to the start time of the cluster. To avoid this additional startup time, or in case of failures in the certificate renewal process, use the following procedure: Procedure To resolve expired certificate errors that cannot be automatically renewed: Download the latest CRC release and place the crc executable in your $PATH. Remove the cluster with certificate errors using the crc delete command: $ crc delete The crc delete command results in the loss of data stored in the CRC instance. Save any desired information stored in the instance before running this command. Set up the new release: $ crc setup Start the new instance: $ crc start Created CRC instances contain bundle information and instance data. Bundle information and instance data is not updated when setting up a new CRC release. This information is not updated due to customization in the earlier instance data. This will lead to errors when running the crc start command: $ crc start ... FATA Bundle 'crc_hyperkit_4.2.8.crcbundle' was requested, but the existing VM is using 'crc_hyperkit_4.2.2.crcbundle' Procedure Issue the crc delete command before attempting to start the instance: $ crc delete The crc delete command results in the loss of data stored in the CRC instance. Save any desired information stored in the instance before running this command. Resolve most issues by restarting CRC with a clean state. This involves stopping the instance, deleting it, reverting changes made by the crc setup command, reapplying those changes, and restarting the instance. Prerequisites You set up the host machine with the crc setup command. For more information, see Setting up CRC. You started CRC with the crc start command. For more information, see Starting the instance. You are using the latest CRC release. Using a version earlier than CRC 1.2.0 might result in errors related to expired x509 certificates. For more information, see Troubleshooting expired certificates. Procedure To troubleshoot CRC, perform the following steps: Stop the CRC instance: $ crc stop Delete the CRC instance: $ crc delete The crc delete command results in the loss of data stored in the CRC instance. Save any desired information stored in the instance before running this command. Clean up remaining changes from the crc setup command: $ crc cleanup The crc cleanup command removes an existing CRC instance and reverts changes to DNS entries created by the crc setup command. Set up your host machine to reapply the changes: $ crc setup Start the CRC instance: $ crc start The cluster takes a minimum of four minutes to start the necessary containers and Operators before serving a request.

Log in to the registry as that user with its token: $ oc registry login --insecure=true Create a new project: $ oc new-project demo Mirror an example container image: $ oc image mirror registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest=default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing/demo/ubi8:latest --insecure=true --filter-by-os=linux/amd64 Get imagestreams and verify that the pushed image is listed: $ oc get is Enable image lookup in the imagestream: $ oc set image-lookup ubi8 This setting allows the imagestream to be the source of images without having to provide the full URL to the internal registry. Create a pod using the recently pushed image: $ oc run demo --image=ubi8 --command -- sleep 600s You can use odo to create OpenShift projects and applications from the command line. This procedure deploys a sample application to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster running in the CRC instance. Prerequisites You have installed odo. For more information, see Installing odo in the odo documentation. CRC is configured to use the OpenShift preset. For more information, see Changing the selected preset. The CRC instance is running. For more information, see Starting the instance. Procedure Log in to the running OpenShift Container Platform cluster managed by CRC as the developer user: $ odo login -u developer -p developer Create a project for your application: $ odo project create sample-app Create a directory for your components: $ mkdir sample-app $ cd sample-app Clone an example Node.js application: $ git clone https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex $ cd nodejs-ex Add a nodejs component to the application: $ odo create nodejs Create a URL and add an entry to the local configuration file: $ odo url create --port 8080 Push the changes: $ odo push Your component is now deployed to the cluster with an accessible URL. List the URLs and check the desired URL for the component: $ odo url list View the deployed application using the generated URL. Additional resources For more information about using odo, see the odo documentation. The crc stop command stops the running CRC instance and container runtime. The stopping process takes a few minutes while the cluster shuts down. Procedure Stop the CRC instance and container runtime: $ crc stop The crc delete command deletes an existing CRC instance. Procedure Delete the CRC instance: $ crc delete The crc delete command results in the loss of data stored in the CRC instance. Save any desired information stored in the instance before running this command.","title":"Using CRC","component":"getting_started","version":"","name":"using","url":"/getting_started/getting_started/using/","titles":[{"text":"About presets","hash":"_about_presets","id":1},{"text":"Setting up CRC","hash":"_setting_up_crc","id":2},{"text":"Starting the instance","hash":"_starting_the_instance","id":3},{"text":"Accessing the OpenShift cluster","hash":"_accessing_the_openshift_cluster","id":4},{"text":"Accessing the OpenShift web console","hash":"_accessing_the_openshift_web_console","id":5},{"text":"Accessing the OpenShift cluster with the OpenShift CLI","hash":"_accessing_the_openshift_cluster_with_the_openshift_cli","id":6},{"text":"Accessing the internal OpenShift registry","hash":"_accessing_the_internal_openshift_registry","id":7},{"text":"Deploying a sample application with odo","hash":"_deploying_a_sample_application_with_odo","id":8},{"text":"Stopping the instance","hash":"_stopping_the_instance","id":9},{"text":"Deleting the instance","hash":"_deleting_the_instance","id":10}]}},"components":{},"componentVersions":{"getting_started/":{"displayVersion":"default","title":"Getting started with CRC","version":"","name":"getting_started","asciidoc":{"attributes":{"env":"site","env-site":"","site-gen":"antora","site-gen-antora":"","attribute-missing":"warn","data-uri":null,"icons":"font","sectanchors":"","source-highlighter":"highlight.js","site-title":"CRC Documentation","site-url":"https://crc.dev/crc","nbsp":"&#160;","project-context":"crc","rh":"Red&#160;Hat","rhel":"Red&#160;Hat Enterprise&#160;Linux","fed":"Fedora","centos":"CentOS","mac":"macOS","msw":"Microsoft Windows","debian":"Debian","ubuntu":"Ubuntu","openshift":"OpenShift","ocp":"OpenShift Container Platform","okd":"OKD","ushift":"MicroShift","prod":"CRC","rh-prod":"CRC","bin":"crc","context":"crc","crc-gsg":"CRC Getting Started Guide","crc-download-url":"https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local","crc-gsg-url":"https://crc.dev/crc/","openshift-installer-url":"https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create","openshift-docs-url":"https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest","openshift-docs-url-landing-page":"https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/welcome/index.html#developer-activities","oc-download-url":"https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/","odo-docs-url":"https://odo.dev/docs/introduction","odo-docs-url-installing":"https://odo.dev/docs/overview/installation","telemetry-notice-url":"https://developers.redhat.com/article/tool-data-collection","rhel-resolved-docs":"https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_and_managing_networking/using-different-dns-servers-for-different-domains_configuring-and-managing-networking","ocp-ver":"4.14","ocp-ver-full":"4.14.3","podman-ver":"4.4.4","prod-ver":"2.30","prod-ver-full":"2.30.0","ushift-ver":"4.14.3"},"sourcemap":true},"url":"/getting_started/getting_started/introducing/","navigation":[{"items":[{"content":"Introducing CRC","url":"/getting_started/getting_started/introducing/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Installing CRC","url":"/getting_started/getting_started/installing/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Using CRC","url":"/getting_started/getting_started/using/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Configuring CRC","url":"/getting_started/getting_started/configuring/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Networking","url":"/getting_started/getting_started/networking/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Administrative tasks","url":"/getting_started/getting_started/administrative-tasks/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Troubleshooting CRC","url":"/getting_started/getting_started/troubleshooting/","urlType":"internal"}],"root":true,"order":0}]}}}})
